                                        <p>&quot;LandiTube&quot; Is an advanced, easy to use PNGTuber engine built from
                                            the ground up using SAMMI over the course of a half year of constant
                                            development. PNGTuber software seems sparse, while other Vtubing related
                                            softwares seem to be targetting the 3D audience.

                                            info?<br>
                                            Are you a furry PNGTuber and want your tails to move a random direction
                                            everytime you talk?</p>
                                        <p>Or...</p>
                                        <p>Maybe you want to add sunglasses to your character, but don&#39;t want to
                                            have to export every image again, or have it only work on one emotion?<br>
                                            Maybe you want your model to have a gamepad display that accurately displays
                                            your controller&#39;s inputs?</p>
                                        <p>Have you ever wanted your PNGTuber to actually interact with your OBS Setup a
                                            bit more? Thanks to the foundation of this engine that is SAMMI, you can do
                                            just that, and so much more.</p>
                                        <p>This data can be used to create your own rendering engine, ontop of the

                                        <p>&quot;Landie thats a big word..&quot;, All it means is that you get to decide
                                            how certain OBS Sources behave, and interact with the PNGTuber Engine!</p>

                                        <p>Here are some examples i quickly whipped up:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Rotate an animated image source of my character&#39;s tails everytime my
                                                talking state changes!</li>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Have this live-updating image source of chat&#39;s emote, move a
                                                specific way based on what pose I have!</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Move this text source slightly when I talk!</li>
                                        </ul>

                                            <li>Gamepad overlay that matches my real inputs!</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Those are just some examples of what is possible with LandiTube! All of this
                                            is possible, and so, so, so much more! The possibilities (and I truly mean
                                            it, not some overhyped thing) are endless!</p>
                                        <p>Oh yeah, and two new SAMMI commands:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>LandiTube: Change Model</li>
                                            <li>LandiTube: Change Emotion</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>but i&#39;m sure you suspected as much :3c</p>

                                            <li>Update banner, should only appear if there is a new update. Clicking the
                                                &quot;More Info&quot; button should reveal a modal with a little bit
                                                more information about what you&#39;ll be installing. Some have

                                            <li>&quot;Refresh Models&quot; is a <em>very important</em> button to get
                                                familiar with. This refreshes the models, and their associated emotions.
                                                You should be clicking this everytime a model, emotion, or pose is added
                                                or removed. Changing an already existing pose should not require a
                                                refresh, but it&#39;s a good habit to have regardless!</li>
                                            <li>&quot;Open Models Folder&quot; is a quick and easy way to get to the
                                                folder where the models are stored. A file explorer window will pop up

                                            <li>This is the models list, all valid models will show up here. You are
                                                required to have at least one model loaded, <strong>and</strong>
                                                selected (depicted by the red box). Models have entirely different sets

                                            <li>&quot;Open Emotions Folder&quot; provides a quick way to get to the
                                                current model&#39;s emotions folder. A file explorer window will pop up

                                            <li>This is the emotions list, which changes depending on which model is
                                                loaded. The emotions list will only load if there is a selected, active
                                                model. You are required to have at least one emotion loaded,
                                                <strong>and</strong> selected (depicted by the red box) for any output.

                                            <li>&quot;Voice Threshold&quot; is the slider for detecting the sensitivity
                                                of your talking. This is a very sensitive slider, and I do not recommend
                                                going above 5!</li>
                                            <li>This allows you to set an input device to listen to for the engine to
                                                read. Great for if you&#39;re looking to use LandiTube as a TTS mascot,
                                                as you can set this to be a virtual audio cable! Make sure to pick the
                                                input that is right for you.</li>

                                        <p>To create models, you create a folder in the &quot;models&quot; folder in the
                                            LandiTube path. All folders inside that folder will create an Icon in your
                                            bridge showing that a model is detected, and exists after a model refresh.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>After adding a models folder, click the &quot;Refresh Models&quot; button in
                                            the bridge to check and see if an icon is generated in the bridge for you!
                                            Once you see your model, click on it! <strong>This will make the model
                                                active, which is required for output.</strong></p>
                                        <p>Here is a visual example of my models folder, where I have two models loaded,

                                        <p>To create emotions for your model, you first need to specify an
                                            &quot;emotions&quot; folder in your unique model&#39;s folder. This is what
                                            it should look like:</p>

                                        <p>In total, your file path should look something like
                                            <code>(LandiTube Path)\models\(unique model folder)\emotions</code>!</p>
                                        <p>Inside your new &quot;emotions&quot; folder, All folders created will create
                                            an Icon in your bridge showing that an emotion is detected, and exists after
                                            a model refresh. </p>
                                        <p>After adding an emotion folder, click the &quot;Refresh Models&quot; button
                                            in the bridge to check and see if an icon is generated in the bridge for you
                                            under your active model! Once you see your emotion, click on it!
                                            <strong>This will make the emotion active, which is required for

                                        <p>Now that your model is set up with proper emotions, lets get to the good
                                            stuff!</p>
                                        <p>In traditional PNGTubing engines, you had 4 poses per emotion: idle, idle
                                            with blink, talking and talking with blink (sometimes you dont even have the
                                            blink).</p>
                                        <p>in &quot;LandiTube&quot;, you&#39;re allowed to have <em>as many idle, and
                                                talking poses as your heart desires</em>. Blinking will be discussed
                                            further down.</p>
                                        <p>What does that mean? Well, everytime you would go into any of the states
                                            mentioned above, it would pick randomly between all of the provided idle,
                                            and talking images. <em>You can have multiple talking poses for a single
                                                expression to really show natural movement, combined with multiple idle
                                                poses!</em></p>
                                        <p>All poses are places inside one of your unique model&#39;s unique emotion
                                            folders!</p>
                                        <p><strong>NOTE: You are not required to include multiple poses of each state,
                                                or add blink frames for them. the option is just available to
                                                you!</strong></p>
                                        <p>lets go over how to set up each state LandiTube provides out of the box!</p>
                                        <h3 id="idling">Idling</h3>
                                        <p>To create an idle pose for your tuber&#39;s emotion, drag in an image file
                                            with the keyword &quot;idle&quot; in it&#39;s filename!</p>
                                        <p>For every image containing the keyword &quot;idle&quot; in it&#39;s file name
                                            inside your emotion folder, those images will be turned into a list of
                                            random poses for &quot;LandiTube&quot; to swap to whenever idling is
                                            supposed to occur.</p>
                                        <p>Example: Lets make <em>three</em> idle poses for an emotion!</p>

                                                <p>Hit &quot;Refresh Models&quot; in your bridge! This should

                                        <h3 id="blinking">Blinking</h3>
                                        <p>Talking, and idle poses do not need to have blinking frames, but they are
                                            nice! One nice feature is that blinking is not &quot;all or nothing&quot;,
                                            you can set blink frames for whatever poses you want!<br>Maybe one idle pose
                                            is meant to be a dead stare while the other idle poses have blinks?<br>Maybe
                                            a character is angry and they don&#39;t blink while talking?</p>
                                        <p>To attach blinking frames to your poses, all you have to do is drag in your
                                            blinking image with the exact file name of the pose you want to give
                                            blinking to, but with &quot;_blink&quot; appended just before the file
                                            extension (.png, .gif)</p>
                                        <p>So &quot;idle.png&quot; becomes &quot;idle_blink.png&quot;, &quot;one paw
                                            talkin.png&quot; becomes &quot;one paw talkin_blink.png&quot;, etc.</p>
                                        <p>Example: Lets add blinking frames to all of our inserted idle, and talking
                                            poses!</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>Have your blinking image files ready! animated or not, its okay!
                                                    every image is the same as the other images inside the emotion&#39;s
                                                    folder, but with &quot;_blink&quot; added. Image below! <img

                                        <h3 id="yelling">Yelling</h3>
                                        <p>Yelling frames are a feature added in 0.14.6 and above, allowing you to
                                            specify an <em>extra</em> talking frame that triggers when your voice
                                            reaches a higher threshold. You can set this threshold in the settings tab!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The threshold should always be <em>above</em> the talk threshold! Just like
                                            the talk threshold, the yelling threshold is sensitive, so keep the number
                                            low!</p>
                                        <p>Yell frames are attatched to any talking pose, sort of like how blink frames
                                            work!</p>
                                        <p>To attach yelling frames to your poses, all you have to do is drag in your
                                            yelling image with the exact file name of the pose you want to give yelling
                                            to, but with &quot;_yell&quot; appended just before the file extension
                                            (.png, .gif)</p>
                                        <p>So &quot;talking fella.png&quot; becomes &quot;talking fella_yell.png&quot;,
                                            &quot;mumble.png&quot; becomes &quot;mumble_yell.png&quot;, etc.</p>
                                        <p>Important note, if you have a yell frame attatched to a pose that
                                            <em>also</em> is intended to be a <strong>blink frame</strong>,
                                            &quot;_yell&quot; <strong>must</strong> be prepended to
                                            &quot;_blink&quot;.<br>Example: &quot;talkin_yell_blink.png&quot; is a yell,
                                            <em>and</em> blink frame!</p>
                                        <p>📝 Example: Let&#39;s add yelling frames for all of my talking poses in an
                                            emotion!</p>
                                        <p>This emotion only has one talking pose and one talking pose with a blink
                                            frame, so I&#39;m providing two yelling frames for each one.</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Gather all of your yelling frames! png, gif, mp4, webm, you name it! You
                                                don&#39;t need to have a yell frame for every single talking pose, just
                                                apply them to the poses you want!</li>
                                            <li>ensure the files are named accordingly. For me, I have one talking pose
                                                &quot;talk.png&quot;, as well as one with a blink frame attatched,
                                                &quot;talk_blink.png&quot;. I want both of these to have a yell
                                                frame!<br>&quot;talk.png&quot; becomes
                                                &quot;talk_yell.png&quot;<br>and<br>&quot;talk_blink.png&quot; becomes
                                                &quot;talk_yell_blink.png&quot;</li>
                                            <li>drag the images into my model&#39;s unique emotion folder!</li>
                                            <li>click &quot;Refresh Models&quot;, bam yelling frames.</li>

                                        <p>When you create a LandiTube model, you draw poses and frames! But what if you
                                            want to give your model a prop, such as...</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A hat that follows your model&#39;s head movement?</li>
                                            <li>A handheld item (pen, drink, food) that follows your model&#39;s hand
                                                movement?</li>
                                            <li>Clothing that has various moving parts?</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Sounds like a pain in the <strong>ASS</strong> to re-draw
                                            <strong>All</strong> of your poses just to have one prop, then create a
                                            whole separate Emotion to toggle to, right??</p>
                                        <p><strong>This is where layers step in!</strong></p>
                                        <p>Layers, introduced in 0.20, are used to dynamically change what is displayed
                                            in front of or behind your model based on its active pose,
                                            <strong>without</strong> directly changing the model itself!</p>
                                        <p>The way this is accomplished is by generating a source which acts as a
                                            freely-transformable reference of an OBS Scene that you can align wherever
                                            you want <em>per pose</em>. It&#39;s not as complex as you think!</p>
                                        <p>Head on over to the &quot;Layers&quot; tab in the bridge so we can try it
                                            out!</p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/P3bCJHh.png" alt="layers tab location"></p>
                                        <p>You should have two layers available to you (for now), Front layer, and Back
                                            Layer. In order to use these we first need to create an OBS Scene for the
                                            layers to reference, so lets go into OBS and create a new scene.<br>I&#39;ll
                                            call mine &quot;Hats&quot;!<br>After doing so, lets add an image of a cute
                                            hat using an Image Source! I&#39;ll align my hat to the center of the scene.
                                        </p>

                                                alt="new obs scene with an image source displaying a tophat"></p>
                                        <p>Back in the bridge, lets set our <em>front</em> layer to the scene
                                            &quot;Hats&quot;. and see what happens!</p>

                                        <p>Woah, thats weird lookin.</p>
                                        <p>What happened, is it has merged <code>[LandiTube]</code>, and the
                                            <code>Hats</code> scene together, and it doesn&#39;t look so great! lets
                                            tweak it!</p>
                                        <p>In OBS, if we go into the <code>[LandiTube] Layers (Front)</code> scene,
                                            we&#39;ll see a source for every pose and frame we have loaded into
                                            LandiTube. Pretty funky names!</p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nb5nia3.png"
                                                alt="all generated sources in layers scene"></p>
                                        <p>Each of these sources are referencing our <code>Hats</code> scene, and we can
                                            freely move these sources as we please! each source is attatched to a pose,
                                            meaning that when poses change, the sources toggle themselves too depending
                                            on what pose you&#39;re on! </p>
                                        <p>We can transform each individual source however we want per loaded pose!</p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FYZgn6B.gif"

                                        <p>We have a bit of a problem though. We can&#39;t see our model, how the heck
                                            are we supposed to align these sources properly??</p>
                                        <p>To see your model <em>and</em> transform the sources in the layer scene at
                                            the same time, right click the <code>[LandiTube] Customize</code> scene and
                                            click &quot;Windowed Projector (Scene)&quot;. This will pop out a window of
                                            this scene, which contains your model, plus it&#39;s layers without the
                                            squishiness so you can align your sources easier!<br>Right click the window
                                            and click &quot;Always On Top&quot; so the window will always be visible
                                            while editing in OBS.</p>

                                        <p>Cool! we can head back to <code>[LandiTube] Layers (Front)</code> and start
                                            messing with our sources and see our model at the same time for alignments.
                                            But there is another issue!<br>It&#39;s <strong>really hard</strong> to
                                            align some poses like ones with blink frames attatched, because they are
                                            only a split second long!<br>I also have trouble selecting the source I
                                            <em>actually</em> want to edit and i keep grabbing all the other ones!</p>
                                        <p>This can all be fixed by using the <strong>Pose Selector!</strong></p>
                                        <p>In the bridge under the &quot;Layers&quot; tab, towards the bottom there is a
                                            &quot;Pose Selector&quot; section!<br>In here, you can click on any pose
                                            loaded for your model which will freeze the engine and allow you to take
                                            your time aligning your sources, as well as making sure only the
                                            corresponding source in the layers scene is able to be transformed.</p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZJATVPO.gif" alt="showcase pose selector"></p>
                                        <p>So much better! So far, everything is going well! We can see our model while
                                            moving around sources in our layers scene, we can freeze the engine to take
                                            our time aligning our sources on a specific pose, and fix the issue of
                                            selecting unrelated sources! Let&#39;s start aligning some sources!</p>
                                        <p>You can crop, squish, stretch, rotate, do anything you want to these sources
                                            to fit them just how you like, to your model! Go nuts!</p>
                                        <p>You may encounter one final hiccup however... what if two poses don&#39;t
                                            have any extra movement in a specific area?? Do I have to manually try to
                                            align them perfectly?</p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5GlB87v.gif" alt="jittery layer"></p>
                                        <p><strong>No!</strong></p>
                                        <p>You can copy and paste transformations between sources in OBS! right click
                                            the source you want to copy all of the transformation properties from, and
                                            click <code>Transform &gt; Copy Transform</code>. from there, right click
                                            the source that you want to have the exact same transformation, and click
                                            <code>Transform &gt; Paste Transform</code>. Perfect! Now they are perfectly
                                            aligned, no jitter!</p>

                                        <p>Here are some pro tips to transform sources easier in OBS:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Use the ARROW keys to nudge sources by the pixel, and hold SHIFT to move
                                                in 5 pixel increments.</li>
                                            <li>Hold the CONTROL key while dragging, or rotating to disable source
                                                snapping to avoid having your sources snap places you don&#39;t want
                                                them!</li>
                                            <li>Holding the SHIFT key while rotating will snap the source rotation by 15
                                                degree increments!</li>
                                            <li>Hold the Left ALT key while dragging a side to easily crop a source
                                                (this is highly not recommended when transforming sources in a layers
                                                scene)</li>
                                            <li>Use filters! each source clone is independant of each other, so you can
                                                add a filter like <a
                                                    href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/3d-effect.1692/">3D
                                                    Effect by Exeldro</a> to move a source in a 3d space, or add a
                                                user-defined shader with the automatically installed obs-shaderfilter
                                                fork by Exeldro and use the <code>corner-pin.shader</code> file to map
                                                corners of a source to different coordinates. Play around! have fun!
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>With this knowledge, you should be a pro at aligning all of these sources
                                            just the way you want them on your model!

                                                otherwise your model will appear frozen when trying to get it to
                                                talk!</span></p>

                                        <p>Okay Landie, I did all of that work and I have a hat that perfectly aligns to
                                            my head. What is the benefit of this again??</p>
                                        <p>Keeping the <code>[LandiTube] Customize</code> scene in a window projector,
                                            heading over to the <code>Hats</code> scene (the scene all of our sources in
                                            our layer scene are referencing), swap the image!</p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4AovIlL.gif" alt="new image source"></p>
                                        <p>As you can see, its now incredibly easy to swap out this hat for any image we
                                            want and have it already apply all the transformations needed to align to
                                            our model! make it a gif, or a png!</p>
                                        <p>But this is an entire <strong>scene</strong> we are working with in OBS.
                                            <br>we have <strong>All types of sources available to us</strong>, not just
                                            Image sources!<br>Get wild! Use a media source, a display capture, maybe a
                                            browser source for friends in a discord call to sit on your head, sky&#39;s
                                            the limit!</p>

                                        <p>Extension triggers are a way for a SAMMI button to be ran based on certain
                                            criteria specified by the Engine. This works exactly like if your button is

                                                href="#documentation">docs</a>, we need to identify which ones we need
                                            for the job.</p>
                                        <p>Lets see. I want the glasses to move around whenever my head tilts from a
                                            pose change! my pose changes when i talk, and when i&#39;m done talking.
                                            Knowing this, we know we will need the following extension triggers on our
                                            button:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>LandiTube talking true</li>
                                            <li>LandiTube talking false</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Something awesome about SAMMI is, you can set a wildcard (<em>) in place of
                                                where the word true/false is so you only need to specify this trigger
                                                once because we want both of those to trigger the button anyways. Our
                                                two extension triggers become one trigger: `LandiTube talking </em>`!
                                            Navigate to the triggers menu of your button, and add that trigger.</p>

                                        <p>We need to identify which poses are moving the head in a way where we will
                                            need to adjust the glasses&#39; <code>Position</code>, and
                                            <code>Rotation</code>. In my case, its two of my idle poses:
                                            <code>idle2</code> and <code>idle3</code>. The head leans to the left on
                                            <code>idle2</code>, and on the right for <code>idle3</code>. All of my other
                                            poses have the head in the center.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/20MbSRk.png"
                                                alt="showing poses that have tilted heads"></p>
                                        <p>In our button, lets pull the pose data using <code>Trigger Pull Data</code>,
                                            and filling the <code>Pull Value</code> box with
                                            &quot;<code>current_state</code>&quot;. This tells us what pose our model is
                                            in at the time the button was triggered which in our case is whenever our
                                            talk state changes. I&#39;ll name the variable <code>currentState</code>!
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Now if we open our variable viewer and chit chat away, we can see this
                                            variable populating with our current pose&#39;s name!</p>

                                            something based off pose data</h2>
                                        <p>I need to check this value for whenever it equals <code>idle2</code>, or
                                            <code>idle3</code> so i can have something happen whenever those poses are
                                            detected.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Let&#39;s add a &quot;Switch Statement&quot;, and fill it&#39;s box with our
                                            <code>currentState</code> variable. A switch statement matches certain cases
                                            of text, so, we need to add three &quot;Case Statement&quot; blocks within
                                            our switch statement block. One case will look for <code>idle2</code>,
                                            another will look for <code>idle3</code>, and since every other pose keeps
                                            the head in the middle, we&#39;ll add a &quot;default&quot; case for our
                                            third block (&quot;default&quot; triggers when the <code>currentState</code>
                                            variable doesn&#39;t match any of the other cases!).
                                        </p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xqhtcl5.png" alt="creating switch case pair">
                                        </p>
                                        <p>&quot;What about the blinks? Aren&#39;t those poses as well?&quot; </p>
                                        <p>Yes! we need to make sure those poses are accounted for as well, even though
                                            we are only triggering this button when our talking state changes, not when
                                            we blink. There is a slight chance that once we finish talking, we&#39;ll
                                            finish while we are blinking, so poses like <code>idle2_blink</code> and
                                            <code>idle3_blink</code> will be checked. We don&#39;t have matching cases
                                            for those which in turn will make the glasses move the wrong way due to
                                            triggering the &quot;default&quot; case!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Thankfully, this is a really simple fix. on each of our case blocks looking
                                            for our idle poses, clicking the little plus ➕ icon next to the text box
                                            will allow us to add another matching case to one case statement block!
                                            since <code>idle2</code> and <code>idle2_blink</code> move the head to the
                                            left, we&#39;ll have those two on one block, while <code>idle3</code> and
                                            <code>idle3_blink</code> are on another.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Okay, I think we have everything. Let&#39;s add some alert messages in these
                                            case statement blocks, to help us determine if we set this up properly!</p>

                                        <p>Success! the alert messages seem accurate, so lets try making the glasses
                                            move now.</p>
                                        <h2 id="source-motion-in-obs-using-move-transition">Source Motion in OBS using
                                            Move Transition</h2>
                                        <p>Unfortunately, SAMMI&#39;s built in motion commands aren&#39;t reliable, but
                                            we have an even better alternative: Exeldro&#39;s &quot;Move
                                            Transition&quot; plugin (that guy is a godsend, please support him). This
                                            plugin is required for LandiTube to even work, so you&#39;ll have it
                                            installed 🙂</p>
                                        <p>Let&#39;s right click the <code>[LandiTube] Customize</code> scene (yes, the
                                            scene) and add a &quot;Move Source&quot; filter on it. we want to move our
                                            glasses, so lets select that source. We want no transitions, so set the
                                            <code>Custom Duration</code> to <code>0ms</code>. <strong>If you can&#39;t
                                                set it to 0, please update Move Transition to the latest version,
                                                you&#39;ll be able to do it and it&#39;s wonderful</strong>!
                                        </p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PbGpHP6.gif" alt="adding a move source filter">

                                        <p>Next, we need to position our glasses. I&#39;ll delegate this filter to
                                            moving our glasses to the middle. In OBS, position the glasses how you want
                                            (rotation, scale, position, all that stuff!) and in the filter&#39;s
                                            settings, hit the <code>Get Transform</code> button. This will take the
                                            current transformation the glasses are in, and inject it into the filter.
                                            congrats! you have your first move state, give it a memorable name! i&#39;ll
                                            call mine &quot;glasses-middle&quot;. </p>

                                        <p>I&#39;ll repeat the process and create &quot;glasses-left&quot; and
                                            &quot;glasses-right&quot;.</p>
                                        <p>Toggling between the filters, looks good to me! </p>

                                        <p>let&#39;s implement these turning on, into our button.
                                            In our cases, put <code>Filter Change Visibility</code> commands to turn the
                                            visibility on for whichever position we&#39;d like the glasses to move to.

                                        <p>are we done? not yet... I change my emotion, and the glasses are still
                                            there... oh no! My other emotions could have entirely different poses that
                                            i&#39;d have to check for, or maybe i just want them on one of my emotions.
                                            the heck do we do?</p>

                                        <p>We could pull the <code>current_emotion</code> variable and check to see if
                                            it&#39;s the right emotion using <code>Trigger Pull Data</code>, then
                                            afterwards, all we do is add an if statement before we begin any &quot;pose
                                            checking&quot;. If the emotion is equal to the emotion we want for these
                                            glasses, show the glasses! otherwise, hide them!</p>

                                        <p> however, remember! This button is setup to only run when our <strong>talking
                                                state</strong> changes. This means that even if we change emotions,
                                            <strong>nothing will happen until we talk again.</strong>
                                        </p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d9DfRRk.gif" alt="oh no it broke"></p>
                                        <p>We need another trigger.</p>
                                        <p>In your triggers menu, add a new <code>Extension Trigger</code> with the name
                                            of</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>LandiTube emotion *</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Now, the button will trigger for any emotion change, and we can properly test
                                            that <code>current_emotion</code> variable. </p>
                                        <p>WHABAM, awesome shades, and I didn&#39;t need to re-export my art files or
                                            get a whole separate emotion set <em>just</em> for some shades!</p>

                                        <h2 id="some-important-things-to-note-">Some important things to note:</h2>
                                        <p>Maybe your SAMMI Installation is doing a bunch of other stuff and causing
                                            slight lag, or maybe you&#39;re changing emotions too fast. Heres what might
                                            happen to you (simulated lag):</p>
                                        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7g32VbG.gif"
                                                alt="hey thats not supposed to happen"></p>
                                        <p>Oh dang, those glasses couldn&#39;t read the emotion somehow, and thought it
                                            was still &quot;chillin&quot;! why??</p>
                                        <p>Maybe you have a complex button, and it takes a while to finish. SAMMI
                                            won&#39;t execute overlapping buttons, however, you can very easily fix this
                                            in two ways.</p>
                                        <p>Turning off &quot;Local Variable Persist&quot; and turning on &quot;Button
                                            Overlap&quot; in the button settings</p>
                                        <p>OR</p>
                                        <p>Turning on &quot;Allow queue&quot; in the button&#39;s settings, and giving
                                            the button a unique group/queue name.</p>
                                        <p>Each of these have their own use cases, but in our case, the easiest would be
                                            the first option, because we aren&#39;t doing anything super complicated.
                                            This allows the button to <em>overlap</em> execution, so if this button is
                                            still running while triggered again maybe from a fast action, it will still
                                            run regardless.</p>
                                        <p>If you have a bit more of a complicated button, and would rather wait until
                                            it is <em>fully</em> done executing because there might be some important
                                            output for another function, add it to a queue instead with option 2! </p>
                                        <p>More tutorials will be made to better get an understanding of when this
                                            should be used.</p>
