# What is it ‚Åâ

This is a unique OBS Widget that is meant to be used with the game [LurkBait Twitch Fishing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767520/LurkBait_Twitch_Fishing/) available on steam!

This widget displays the person fishing in the game, and plays an animation of them casting, getting a snag, reeling in, and displaying their catch! In the future, I plan to add a feature that records a short gif of the catch screen then posts it to a specified discord channel.

Please ensure that you head over to the [Setup](#setup) tab so you know how to install and use it on your streams!

This is one of my more polished extensions so it costs a small fee, but you should expect top notch quality from me since I rarely ever charge on anything I make! Thank you for considering to support me!
