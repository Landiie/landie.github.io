# What is it ‚Åâ

This gives SAMMI Text-to-speech capabilities utilizing the Windows speech APIs 4 and 5!

Thats big words for "you can use system built-in text-to-speech in SAMMI".

The amount of voices you have entirely depends on what language packs you have installed in Windows for either SAPI 4 or 5. This extension comes bundled in with at least *29 SAPI4 voices* some of which you may recognize because Windows SAPI is often used in YouTube videos for it's comedic effect!


It is recommended to do some research on what kind of voices are available using these systems, but in the [setup](#setup) page will be some resources where you can find some more packages to download.

Audio is played through it's own application, `balcon.exe`, meaning that in OBS, you can capture this audio's output directly to manage it *independant* from all other audio sources if you're _not_ using Desktop audio capture (the best way to manage audio)

If you _are_ using Desktop audio capture (shame on you!), fear not, as the extension allows you to change the audio device in which the audio comes out from! Pick an unused audio device, then add a new audio output capture in OBS and you're off to the races! Control the audio how you want!

Make sure to head over to [setup](#setup) to get started!

To learn how to use this extension in your SAMMI projects after setting it up, check the documentation tab!
