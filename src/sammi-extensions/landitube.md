# Help! I'm new to SAMMI, and I want to use this! What do I do?

Please check out this [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkz264Ax6qc) I made to help newcomers get SAMMI set up with the bare minimum they need to use this extension!

# What is this?

![introducing landitube](https://i.imgur.com/IsovjaP.gif)

"LandiTube" Is an advanced, easy to use PNGTuber engine built from the ground up using SAMMI over the course of a half year of constant development. PNGTuber software seems sparse, while other Vtubing related softwares seem to be targetting the 3D audience.
<br>
<br>
I'm here to change that.

# What does this offer that other engines don't?

Plenty!!

And now for the **Big 2 Features.** First up...

All of data is sent to you in the form of these extension triggers:

| Extension Trigger                 | Description                                                                   |

**\_**Woah woah woah Landie slow down!! I don't know how to use this!**\_**

That's alright! No SAMMI knowledge is required to get up and running with this engine. however, if you want to capitalize on this amount of freedom and take your PNGTuber to the next level; SAMMI is an incredible, easy, and fun software to use to build your dream stream projects (no coding knowledge needed at all! thats how i started!). You can get started by reading the documentation [Here!](https://sammi.solutions/docs) if you want to learn more about whats coming up next...

What are you supposed to do with this info? Well, thats where the second _huge_ feature comes in...

## Full OBS Source Layering System

Are you a TV Head PNGTuber and want your tv head to display twitch alert info?<br>
Are you a furry PNGTuber and want your tails to move a random direction everytime you talk?

Or...

Maybe you want to add sunglasses to your character, but don't want to have to export every image again, or have it only work on one emotion?<br>
Maybe you want your model to have a gamepad display that accurately displays your controller's inputs?

Have you ever wanted your PNGTuber to actually interact with your OBS Setup a bit more? Thanks to the foundation of this engine that is SAMMI, you can do just that, and so much more.

This data can be used to create your own rendering engine, ontop of the default one shipped with this extension (to be changed in 1.0.0)!

"Landie thats a big word..", All it means is that you get to decide how certain OBS Sources behave, and interact with the PNGTuber Engine!

### Examples:

Here are some examples i quickly whipped up:

- Rotate an animated image source of my character's tails everytime my talking state changes!

![Landie but awesome](https://i.imgur.com/m7teWZL.gif)

- Have this live-updating image source of chat's emote, move a specific way based on what pose I have!

![](https://i.imgur.com/jdNp3ZY.gif)

- Move this text source slightly when I talk!

![](https://i.imgur.com/VHfH82R.gif)

- Gamepad overlay that matches my real inputs!

![](https://i.imgur.com/TGdMj0A.gif)

Those are just some examples of what is possible with LandiTube! All of this is possible, and so, so, so much more! The possibilities (and I truly mean it, not some overhyped thing) are endless!

Oh yeah, and two new SAMMI commands:

- LandiTube: Change Model
- LandiTube: Change Emotion

but i'm sure you suspected as much :3c
