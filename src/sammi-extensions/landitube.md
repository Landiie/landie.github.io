**Please keep in mind this is a beta release, and is not expected to work correctly under certain circumstances. You can really help out by reporting these bugs via <br>[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZTbMw7TVKa)<br>Direct Discord DM: Landie#0038<br>Email at landieinquiries@gmail.com**

# Help! I'm new to SAMMI, and I want to use this! What do I do?

Please check out this [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkz264Ax6qc) I made to help newcomers get SAMMI set up with the bare minimum they need to use this extension!

# What is this?

![introducing landitube](https://i.imgur.com/IsovjaP.gif)

"LandiTube" Is an advanced, easy to use PNGTuber engine built from the ground up using SAMMI over the course of a half year of constant development. PNGTuber software seems sparse, while other Vtubing related softwares seem to be targetting the 3D audience.
<br>
<br>
I'm here to change that.

# What does this offer that other engines don't?

Plenty!!

- Infinite Models ‚ôæÔ∏è

And now for the **Big 2 Features.** First up...

## Full SAMMI Integration and Public API

All of data is sent to you in the form of these extension triggers:

| Extension Trigger                 | Description                                                                   |

**\_**Woah woah woah Landie slow down!! I don't know how to use this!**\_**

That's alright! No SAMMI knowledge is required to get up and running with this engine. however, if you want to capitalize on this amount of freedom and take your PNGTuber to the next level; SAMMI is an incredible, easy, and fun software to use to build your dream stream projects (no coding knowledge needed at all! thats how i started!). You can get started by reading the documentation [Here!](https://sammi.solutions/docs) if you want to learn more about whats coming up next...

What are you supposed to do with this info? Well, thats where the second _huge_ feature comes in...

## Full OBS Source Layering System

Are you a TV Head PNGTuber and want your tv head to display twitch alert info?<br>
Are you a furry PNGTuber and want your tails to move a random direction everytime you talk?

Or...

Maybe you want to add sunglasses to your character, but don't want to have to export every image again, or have it only work on one emotion?<br>
Maybe you want your model to have a gamepad display that accurately displays your controller's inputs?

Have you ever wanted your PNGTuber to actually interact with your OBS Setup a bit more? Thanks to the foundation of this engine that is SAMMI, you can do just that, and so much more.

This data can be used to create your own rendering engine, ontop of the default one shipped with this extension (to be changed in 1.0.0)!

"Landie thats a big word..", All it means is that you get to decide how certain OBS Sources behave, and interact with the PNGTuber Engine!

### Examples:

Here are some examples i quickly whipped up:

- Rotate an animated image source of my character's tails everytime my talking state changes!

![Landie but awesome](https://i.imgur.com/m7teWZL.gif)

- Have this live-updating image source of chat's emote, move a specific way based on what pose I have!

![](https://i.imgur.com/jdNp3ZY.gif)

- Move this text source slightly when I talk!

![](https://i.imgur.com/VHfH82R.gif)

- Gamepad overlay that matches my real inputs!

![](https://i.imgur.com/TGdMj0A.gif)

Those are just some examples of what is possible with LandiTube! All of this is possible, and so, so, so much more! The possibilities (and I truly mean it, not some overhyped thing) are endless!

Oh yeah, and two new SAMMI commands:

- LandiTube: Change Model
- LandiTube: Change Emotion

but i'm sure you suspected as much :3c

What are you waiting for? Check out the [Setup](#setup) page for prerequisites, and download!

# Welcome to the helpdesk!

Sorry you had to come here, I'm trying my best! Check out the sidebar to see if there is anything related to the issue you're experiencing!

# Installation

## I Keep getting yellow messages telling me that I need OBS scenes, what?

Please refer to the [setup](#setup) tab to install your OBS scenes using the Source Copy OBS plugin.

## Whenever I startup SAMMI with LandiTube installed, it takes FOREVER to load and sometimes crashes

Make sure you have your Local API enabled in the SAMMI settings, as per instructions from installing the "Folder Reader" extension.

Do not set a password!

# Models

## I made a model folder, but i can't find it in the bridge!

Make sure your model folder is located in `(YOURSAMMIINSTALL)\Landies_Extensions\LandiTuber\models` folder.

Make sure to select it in the bridge afterwards!

---

# Emotions

## I added my emotions inside my models folder but when i refresh nothing happens!

You need to make an "emotions" folder inside your unique model's folder **first**, and make your emotion folders within there. Common mistake!

Make sure to select at least one emotion once you set them up.

---

# Poses

---

# Display

## One of my model's poses is huge, and not aligned properly!

0.14.6^ use a dynamic source creation process to add your poses, and sometimes things happen during that process and don't get created properly!

Thankfully, this is an easy fix!

1.  Head over to the `[LandiTube] Default Renderer` scene
2.  Locate the problematic source (to locate, look for the problematic source that has the model name at the beginning emotion name in middle, and pose name at the end for easy finding.
3.  Delete the source!
4.  In the bridge under the LandiTube tab, click "Refresh Models"
5.  Give it a moment to regenerate the missing source, and see if it fixed your issue!

If the issue persists even when deleting the source, try it again, as it's a rare bug! once its fixed, _you should never have to touch it again unless you remove the model!_

---

# Settings

## I can't change the settings, I already have OBS Connected!

Try restarting SAMMI. This is common on first installations, and I'm still tracking it down! Restarting SAMMI should fix this no problem c:

## My voice isn't being picked up!

There might be four things causing this:

1.  Input device not set

    1.  Head on over to the bridge, click the "LandiTube" tab.
    2.  Click the "Input Source" dropdown button to select your input device!  
        If you don't see your device there, or, you select it and nothing changes, [check the below issue](#here)!

2.  Move Transition OBS Plugin not installed

    1.  Head on over to the [Move Transition Download Page](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/)
    2.  Make sure you are downloading 2.8.1 or higher!
    3.  Close OBS, install, and re-open OBS.
    4.  Reinstall LandiTube if nothing fixes right away

3.  Voice Threshold is too high
    1.  Head on over to the bridge, click the "LandiTube" tab.
    2.  adjust the "Voice Threshold"
4.  Weird SAMMI issue  
    Sometimes, SAMMI breaks when reading an OBS source and is unable to get the visbility state that is being constantly changed. Heres what to do:
    1.  Head over to SAMMI's "OBS Connection" settings and Disconnect, then reconnect OBS.
    2.  This should fix your issue, if not, try one more time, then let me know you're still struggling. It works eventually, and once it starts working after install, i've never had a problem with it happening again :3c
5.  Delete OBS Scenes, reinstall Scenes  
    Rarely, upon installation move transition will fail to pick up any input (discovered thanks to PixelGourmet) and the solution is to reinstall the scenes a specific way!

    1.  Delete all scenes with the prefix "\[LandiTube\]"
    2.  Disconnect SAMMI from OBS in SAMMI's "OBS Connections" menu temporarily
    3.  Reinstall scenes from "LandiTube Scenes.json"
    4.  Reconnect SAMMI to OBS from "OBS Connections" within SAMMI
    5.  Change the input device of "LandiTube Voice" located in the scene "\[LandiTube\] Model Movement"
    6.  Hopefully everything is good?

    If you don't see your device there, or, you select it and nothing changes, check the below issue!

## I cant select my input device, or, I selected my device and nothing is happening!

Unfortunately it looks like i suck, and the interface i made for selecting your input source doesn't work right.

There is a way to fix this, but its a bit more manual! follow these steps:

1.  Head over to OBS, and check out the "`[LandiTube] Model Movement`" scene.
2.  Click on the source "LandiTube Voice", hit properties, and change it to your input device.
3.  Afterwards, if nothing happens when you speak, enable and disable the LandiTube Voice source. This should work!

# 0.20.0

NOTE: This is an insurmountably VAST update that essentially makes this an entirely different extension. The patch notes were mades based off of memory, as I wasn't making it during the patch process and only after it was complete.

### üîä NEW MODULES:

- **‚ú®Transitions**, allows certain modules of LandiTube to have transitions. Currently only supports transitions between emotions. Read more about it in the documentation!
- **‚ú®Dynamic Transitions**, allows certain modules of LandiTube to have transitions based on module factors. Currently only supports dynamic transition "outros" and "intros" between emotions. read more about it in the documentation!
- **‚ú®Dynamic Lighting**, set a scene to be referenced to enable global lighting of certain modules such as models, transitions, layers, and custom sources in the `[LandiTube] Customize` scene
- **‚ú®Dynamic Rim Lighting**, set a scene to be referenced to enable global rim lighting of certain modules such as models, transitions, layers, and custom sources in the `[LandiTube] Customize` scene. change the direction of rim lighting aswell!
- **‚ú®Model Importing (veadomini)**, Import a model from veadotube mini (not associated with LandiTube) and get started with LandiTube sooner if this isn't your first time with a 2D Vtuber!
- **‚ú®OBS Source Layering v3**, putting this here because nobody used layering due to lack of tutorials and tedium, so here is a way more polished version of obs source layering! comes with a front and back layer, set the layer's scene reference in the Bridge, manipulate auto-generated layer poses within OBS! check documentation and tutorials for more.
- **‚ú®Backups**, yay! Currently only supports backing up but no restoration yet. Dedicated Backups tab exists in bridge where you can manually backup if you wish, or, landitube will back up automatically after every full day and stores up to a max of 5. Stores all models and their graphics, configs, etc
- **‚ú®Twitch Integration**, currently only asks to add the "LandiTube" tag to your stream and how to link twitch to SAMMI, more will be done with this in the future.
- **‚ú®Logger**, reworked the entire codebase to log out at certain points to `landitube.log`, located in `(SAMMI INSTALL)\Landies_Extensions\LandiTuber\landitube.log`. Will be extremely useful for troubleshooting on my side and the end user side.
- **‚ú®Automatic OBS Plugin Installer/Checker**, detects missing or out of date obs plugins which then are automatically installed for you. failsafe of opening download link for you to download and place .zip in a special folder to auto install aswell
- **‚ú®Automatic Bridge version checker**, checks bridge version to ensure up to date version.
- **‚ú®Automatic SAMMI Extension version checker**, checks required SAMMI Extensions to ensure versions are up to date.
- **‚ú®.fenc Config Files**, used to tweak individual poses/emotions/models to interact with LandiTube modules independantly instead of globally. Current instances of usage:
  - Global Transitions
  - Dynamic Transitions
- **‚ú®Custom WPF/WinForms Windows**, finally LandiTube looks more like your other programs when prompted with windows! Enjoy pretty, informative, and efficient popups whenever the time arises!

### NEW:

- Twitch account checker, asks to link twitch on startup
- "OBS Source Layers" tab
- OBS Source Layers configuration
- moved "Poses" into OBS tab, renamed to "Pose Selector" for OBS Source Layer editing

- Fixed landie not getting their proper amount of sleep
- Fixed issue with bridge being disconnected mid install
- Fixed model loading without any visuals at random times
