# Introduction

Welcome to Windows TTS!

This extension leverages the Windows Speech APIs (SAPI) included in your system, both SAPI 4 and 5, as well as the application `balabolka.exe` in order to give SAMMI TTS abilities.

SAPI 4 is slightly older, but is often used in comedy videos with iconic TTS voices. This extension includes packages for up to 29 of these SAPI 4 voices, however, you can aquire more if you know where to find them.

SAPI 5 is the latest version of Windows TTS, which is commonly used when using the built-in annotator. These voices are downloaded through Windows language packs which you can install via installing a new language into your Windows installation. OR, you can download packages online.

A common place to find these voices, and know what others exist out there, is [Zero2000](https://www.zero2000.com/free-text-to-speech-natural-voices.html). This site contains packages of free SAPI voices, as well as commercial ones and where to find and buy them.

To refresh any installed voices, refresh your SAMMI Bridge!

Alright, intro is over, let's get into it!
