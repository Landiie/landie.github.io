# Getting Started

## Installation

1.  Download the .sef file
2.  Install the .sef file via the left hand side menu of the core, clicking the bridge button, then clicking "Install an Extension".

## General Extension Command Usage

![local variable persist visual](./command-usage-1.png)

When you use these commands, any command that stores data in a variable must be a **persistent** button. You can check and change your button's persistence by checking that button's settings. This is a limitation of SAMMI, so this must be done for your variable saving commands to work.

A slightly **purple colored** command implies that the command is **not instant**. This means that you have to provide a delay, or, what is recommended, a `Wait Until Variable Exists` command block right after, which halts everything until that command returns the data that is required for the rest of the button to work. **Since buttons are persistent, you must have a `Delete Variable` command in the top of your button to ensure that it is properly waiting for new data to exist**.

![purple command proper usage](./command-usage-2.png)

1.  `Delete Variable`: ensures that the `Wait Until Variable Exists` command waits for a brand new variable to exist
2.  `Purple Extension Command`: indicates that the command doesn't return the information instantly. must be paired with delay.
3.  `Wait Until Variable Exists`: A delay, halting the rest of the button, until the data exists within LB or the timeout is reached.

Then do whatever you want with that sweet, sweet data!

## Updating

I value updates a lot, so i can ensure everyone has the top quality product! When the bridge connects, there is an automatic update check. If there is a new update available, an alert message will be displayed in your core to check your bridge for an update button which checks, and provides a link to the releases section of this extension.

If you have a lot of alert messages pop up on bridge connect, you might miss it. I recommend clicking the "Check for updates" button in this extension's tab in the bridge every so often, or if you encounter an issue out of the blue.

### ‚ö† Updating Procedure

To update this extension, please follow the steps below!

1.  Install the .sef file via the left hand side menu of the core, clicking the bridge button, then clicking "Install an Extension".
2.  Allow it to replace the deck it prompts
3.  üëç (ur good)
