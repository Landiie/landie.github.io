‚ùì What is this?
===============

Check out the video!

This extension gives SAMMI controller support via the HTML5 Gamepad API! Trigger buttons with your controller by pressing and releasing buttons, shifting the analog stick, and using analog triggers!

Buttons are triggered via "Extension Triggers", which are explained in the [docs](#documentation)! With every extension trigger attatched to a button, you're able to pull lots of data about your controller via `Trigger Pull Data` such as joystick position, angle, radians, and more!

If your controller works on [gamepadviewer.com](https://gamepadviewer.com), it should work with this extension. Before purchasing, check there!
