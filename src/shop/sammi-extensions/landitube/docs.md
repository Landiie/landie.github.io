# Bridge and You!

![landitube in the bridge with highlighted](./landitube-docs-1.png)

This is what your bridge will look like! lets run by section.

1.  "LandiTube" bridge tab. This is how you access the web interface for "LandiTube" after installing.
2.  Defining information about the extension, such as Title, Authors, and their socials. You can see if i'm live or not by the little red circle next to the twitch icon!
3.  Update banner, should only appear if there is a new update. Clicking the "More Info" button should reveal a modal with a little bit more information about what you'll be installing. Some have important warnings, so be sure to read!
4.  "Refresh Models" is a _very important_ button to get familiar with. This refreshes the models, and their associated emotions. You should be clicking this everytime a model, emotion, or pose is added or removed. Changing an already existing pose should not require a refresh, but it's a good habit to have regardless!
5.  "Open Models Folder" is a quick and easy way to get to the folder where the models are stored. A file explorer window will pop up c:
6.  This is the models list, all valid models will show up here. You are required to have at least one model loaded, **and** selected (depicted by the red box). Models have entirely different sets of emotions!
7.  "Open Emotions Folder" provides a quick way to get to the current model's emotions folder. A file explorer window will pop up c:
8.  This is the emotions list, which changes depending on which model is loaded. The emotions list will only load if there is a selected, active model. You are required to have at least one emotion loaded, **and** selected (depicted by the red box) for any output.
9.  "Voice Threshold" is the slider for detecting the sensitivity of your talking. This is a very sensitive slider, and I do not recommend going above 5!
10.  This allows you to set an input device to listen to for the engine to read. Great for if you're looking to use LandiTube as a TTS mascot, as you can set this to be a virtual audio cable! Make sure to pick the input that is right for you.
11.  Support footer, which has my donation info, and a direct link to my shop where I have even more extensions (that can interface with this one to create some incredible pngtuber combos!). I would really appreciate it if I could at least get a dollar every now and then ðŸ’š
